## Project Justification
E-commerce website functionality: This project allows us to practice fundamental features such as user registration, login, product pages, shopping cart, ordering, and payment.

Product and category management: Aesop is known for prioritizing products over marketing. The brand's website contains rich information on products and categories. Through this clone project, we can practice how to efficiently separate and store various categories and types of products' data and how to visually represent them.

Design inspiration: Aesop is famous for its minimalistic and sophisticated design. Cloning the website helps us gain design inspiration to develop visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces.
